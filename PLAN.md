# Pentesting Assistant Tool - Development Plan

## Vision
Transform the Groq CLI into a comprehensive pentesting assistant that helps security researchers with authorized bug bounty programs and ethical hacking engagements.

## Core Objectives
- Assist with reconnaissance and enumeration
- Execute security testing commands and tools
- Generate professional reports for bug bounty platforms
- Maintain scope awareness and compliance
- Provide methodology guidance

## Architecture Components

### 1. Scope Management System
- **Scope Definition Module**
  - Define in-scope domains, IPs, and assets
  - Track out-of-scope exclusions
  - Validate all commands against scope before execution
  - Maintain engagement rules and limitations

- **Authorization Tracking**
  - Store program/engagement details
  - Track VDP/BBP platform credentials
  - Manage ROE (Rules of Engagement) documents

### 2. Reconnaissance Module
- **Passive Recon Tools**
  - DNS enumeration
  - Subdomain discovery
  - Port scanning
  - Service identification
  - Technology stack fingerprinting

- **OSINT Integration**
  - Public data source queries
  - Certificate transparency logs
  - Archive searches
  - Social media reconnaissance

### 3. Testing Automation
- **Tool Integration Layer**
  - Common security tool wrappers
  - Output parsing and normalization
  - Result correlation and deduplication
  - Progress tracking and resumption

- **Workflow Orchestration**
  - Methodology templates (OWASP, PTES, etc.)
  - Automated testing chains
  - Conditional execution flows
  - Parallel task execution

### 4. Vulnerability Management
- **Finding Tracker**
  - Vulnerability database
  - Evidence collection and storage
  - CVSS scoring automation
  - Duplicate detection

- **Proof of Concept Management**
  - PoC code storage
  - Screenshot management
  - Request/response capture
  - Video recording integration

### 5. Reporting Engine
- **Report Generation**
  - Multiple format support (PDF, HTML, Markdown)
  - Platform-specific templates (HackerOne, Bugcrowd, etc.)
  - Executive summaries
  - Technical deep-dives

- **Submission Automation**
  - API integration with bug bounty platforms
  - Submission tracking
  - Response monitoring
  - Bounty tracking

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Extend command system for security tools
- [ ] Implement scope management
- [ ] Add basic reconnaissance commands
- [ ] Create finding storage system

### Phase 2: Tool Integration (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Integrate common security tools
- [ ] Build output parsers
- [ ] Implement result correlation
- [ ] Add workflow templates

### Phase 3: Intelligence Layer (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Add OSINT capabilities
- [ ] Implement vulnerability correlation
- [ ] Build CVSS calculator
- [ ] Create evidence management

### Phase 4: Reporting & Automation (Week 7-8)
- [ ] Build report generator
- [ ] Add platform integrations
- [ ] Implement submission automation
- [ ] Create dashboard views

## Technical Modifications Needed

### New Commands
- `/scope` - Manage target scope
- `/recon` - Start reconnaissance
- `/scan` - Execute scanning tools
- `/finding` - Record vulnerabilities
- `/report` - Generate reports
- `/submit` - Submit to platforms

### New Tools
- Network analysis tools
- Web application testing tools
- Vulnerability scanners
- OSINT collectors
- Report generators

### Data Storage
- SQLite database for findings
- File system for evidence
- Encrypted credential storage
- Session management

### UI Enhancements
- Progress indicators for long-running tasks
- Multi-panel views for results
- Interactive finding browser
- Real-time log streaming

## Security Considerations
- All operations require explicit scope definition
- Command logging for audit trails
- Encrypted storage for sensitive data
- Rate limiting for API calls
- Automatic scope validation

## Compliance Features
- Engagement rule enforcement
- Out-of-scope prevention
- Activity logging
- Time-based restrictions
- Geographic limitations

## Success Metrics
- Reduced time from discovery to report
- Increased finding quality scores
- Higher acceptance rates
- Improved report consistency
- Better scope compliance

## Risk Mitigation
- Clear "authorized testing only" warnings
- Scope validation before every action
- Audit logs for all operations
- Legal disclaimer requirements
- Platform ToS compliance checks

## Future Enhancements
- AI-powered vulnerability correlation
- Automated exploit generation
- Collaborative team features
- Mobile application support
- Cloud deployment options
